# Grin mining MC simulation
This simulation is designed to study the evolution of the mining parameters of Grin, such as the difficulty, average time between blocks, primary/secondary PoW ratio and scaling factor. Still very much a WIP. Pull requests with improvements/fixes welcome! Things that are planned to be added:
* Simulation scenario objects, that can be configured and ran
* Histogram for fraction of primary PoW blocks

## Usage
* Run `python simulation.py`
* Open `charts.html` in a browser
